### Overview of the Diao lab research
As a functional genomics lab, we are developing innovative genome profiling and engineering approaches to delineate how the changes of chromatin modification and structure impact gene expression. As cell biology lab, we seek to understand the gene regulation mechanisms underlying cell fate control in development, regeneration, and human diseases such as muscular dystrophy, limb ischemia, aging, and cancer. 

Facilitating the integration of both of these lab research goals is bioinformatics or computational biology, which constitutes computational and analytical methods through which cell biology insights can be extracted from raw genomic data.
